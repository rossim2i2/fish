# Second Powerhead and First Water Change

I’ve been noticing that the right side of the tank didn’t really have
any surface breakage and that a film would just sit there. After asking
around on the internet, everyone basically said the same thing... one
powerhead in a 75 gallon isn’t enough.

I picked up a second Hydor and have been trying to get the right
placement. I put it on the back of the glass on the right side, pointing
as fat towards the middle front glass as possible. It certainly broke up
the surface tension but it also displaced all the sand in the front of
the tank by morning.

I have it on the right side of the tank now, where I can position it
more diagonal toward the left/front of the tank. It seems it will be
trial and error to get that right spot that doesn’t mess up the sand. So
far I’m 0-2.

I also did my first water change. About 10 gallons. Going to keep this
up weekly. Tomorrow I’ll replenish my salt water reserves and cook up
some fresh RODI water.

Corals are mad at me right now due to the water change, but here are
some shots from earlier today. Hopefully everyone in the tank is happy
come morning

I’m also looking at some filters for the iPhone which should allow me to
take much better pictures, without everything looking blue.
