# Keeping Steady

Not much went on this week, but next week is shaping up to be
interesting. The durso overflow has started making a lot of noise.
Gurgling or like a toilet flushing. Seems to be due to the return pump
putting more water in the tank quicker than the drain can remove it.
Therefore I’m going to hard plum the sump and put a valve to lower the
return flow. Only problem is that the valve isn’t in stock anywhere so I
had to order it online. All the PVC is already in my shopping cart for
Home Depot and that will be next weekends project!

either one of my kids could have done this better Depending on how
things work out, we may get more fish next week as well. Parameters have
been holding steady and phosphates have slowly been coming down (0.39
last I checked). I have some GFO on its way as well, which should
basically eliminate it all.

Tank still had some green algae on the rocks so it’s time for more clean
up crew (CUC) as well.

Tangs are hiding Also been reading up on how to get better pictures. The
blue lights on the tank make getting decent looking shots difficult. I’m
going to order an orange gel filter which seems to do a great job
neutralizing the blue tint. In the meantime I have picked up some other
pointers. Still need to get some good fish shots though.

Hopefully a lot more updates next week! Here are some of my latest
pictures.
