# Sump and Filtration

Here are some pictures of my sump and skimmer. I didn’t realize the
filter sock should be added even if you aren’t adding media to it, so I
put it in today. Tomorrow we will get the water levels tested and maybe
get a couple of clown fish.

Looking forward to getting some cleanup crew in there as well,
although I need to wait until there is enough algae and bacteria in the
tank to support them.
