# Algae and Cleanup Crew

I noticed some algae growing on a low flow rock and beginning to take
hold elsewhere. Went to the LFS to pick up the cleanup crew. Some
snails, hermit crabs, an emerald crab and a cleaner shrimp. I’d like
some sand shifting snails and a starfish, but they didn’t have any
available.

They said my phosphate levels were over 1! That is extremely high and
would certainly cause the algae. I got a media bag that is supposed to
bring it down, but have no idea why it’s so high. I also ordered
phosphate and Nitrate test kits so I can keep an eye on the levels in
the future.

A trip to the LFS wouldn’t be complete without a new frag. Got a
small zoa frag. Tried a freshwater dip using RODI water, but the water
was cold. They don’t look too good and hopefully I didn’t kill them.
