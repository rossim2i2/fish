# RIP Dori and Bubbles

Sadly the Yellow Tang, Bubbles, didn't make it through the night.  And
Dori, the Blue Tang passed this afternoon.  Tangs are known to tolerate
copper treatment pretty well.  We are guessing whatever bacterial
infection or parasite that made them sick, already began doing a number
on their system.  Then they were stressed and shocked by the move to QT.
And copper can add more stress to them.

We feel awful, but at the same time are trying to remind ourselves that
if we did nothing, the outcome would be the same.  It may have been
months down the road, but something is making them sick and when the did
pass, we'd need to QT all remaining fish and start the fallow period.

We really wish we weren't in such a rush at the start.  No good things
in this hobby come quickly.  We will replace them, and the Gramma that
went missing in time.  But each will be quarantined before setting fin
in the display tank.

Kids know about the Yellow Tang, but don't know about Dori yet.  We'll
need to break the news to them tomorrow :(
