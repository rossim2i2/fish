# Quick Update

Haven't posted anything for about a week so I thought I would give a
quick update.  Everything is going good.  Have some brown algae on the
rocks that is starting to turn green.  Nothing too bad though.  I only
have about 10 snails and five hermit crabs in there, so I will pick up
some more this weekend as there is now more food for them.  Also going
to get the water checked this weekend and possibly come home with a new
fish (and probably a new frag as well).  Phosphates are still a high at
around 0.45 so I may get a new bag of Phos-Guard as well to try to bring
it down more.
