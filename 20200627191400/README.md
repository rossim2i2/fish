# Rediscovering Saltwater Aquariums

My last saltwater reef tank was over 15 years ago. I’ve always wanted to
get back into it and finally had the opportunity. We were going to get a
freshwater tank but my wife loved the look of saltwater even though it’s
a lot more expensive.

We decided on a 75 gallon reef ready tank. It will be fish only with
maybe a few mushrooms for a year or so. I would then like to upgrade the
lighting and start adding more coral.

Today is day 3 of having the tank up and running. I set up an RODI
station in the basement and got two 32 gallon trash cans for storage.
One for the fresh RODI and one for mixing saltwater.

The tank and equipment were ready for pickup on Saturday, June 20th
(Father’s Day). Unfortunately, the stand was not delivered and we had to
wait until Wednesday to pick it up. The water was ready to go and we
picked up 50 lbs of dry rock to start the tank off with.

The next day we picked up 25 lbs of live rock to really get the cycle
going and finished up the aquascaping.

Lights are only turned on for a few minutes each day as we don’t want
the lights to fuel an algae outbreak.

I hope to keep this blog going with daily updates. If that becomes too
much, I hope to update at least weekly and plan on taking a picture
every day for the first year.
