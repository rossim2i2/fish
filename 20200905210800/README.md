# Quarantine (QT) and Going Fallow

As stated in my post yesterday, my tank has ich.  And likely other
parasites as well.  Itâ€™s a hard lesson to learn that you should always
quarantine your fish.  There are two things I need to do now:

1. Cure/medicate the fish
1. Clean the 75 Gallon of all parasites

To quarantine and medicate the fish, Iâ€™m following Humble Fishâ€™s QT
Protocol.  I already picked up and set up a 37-gallon tank to use for
QT.  Once the tank is ready for the fish, Iâ€™ll need to break down the
display tank and move all the fish to the QT tank where they will be
treated with copper and other medications for brooklynella, flukes,
internal worms/parasites, marine ich, marine velvet disease, trichodina
and uronema.

It is not going to be a fun process.  Just getting the fish out of the
display tank (DT) and into the quarantine tank (QT) is going to be a
nightmare.  In addition to daily observation (which I do anyway), Copper
and Metroplex will be administered over 30 days.  That is after taking a
week to get the copper to the therapeutic level.  Once that time has
passed and the copper levels are brought down to zero, its time to
deworm the fish.  This is another two-week process.  At this point, the
fish should be healthy and its recommended to observe them for another
two weeks before putting them back in the DT.  However, we will talk
more about that later as the DT needs to be parasite free before putting
any fish back.

So, what does a QT Tank look like?  I actually got two tanks, but
besides the size, they are going to be set up the same.  The second is a
10-gallon tank to have on standby if needed and for any new fish in the
future we introduce.

I bought the 37-gallon tank kit from PetSmart.  It comes with a hang-on
back (HOB) filter, a heater, a thermostat and a hood with a light.  The
hood is essential and the fish are prone to jump, especially when being
medicated.

The filter material the tank came with cannot be used though.  It seems
to be some type of combination of media, which includes carbon.  Carbon
will remove the copper.  Instead, I bought Aqua Clear Foam Filters and
Bio Max Filters that seem to fit in this filter just fine.  I also wonâ€™t
be using the thermometer as it keeps losing suction and falling off the
glass.  I bought a cheap heater controller online which will allow me to
fully control the temperature of the water in the tank.

Other than that, I have the Seachem Alert Ammonia Detector.  I learned
that many ammonia tests can produce false results when you have copper
in the system.  However, this one works great and just sticks to the
glass.  Iâ€™m also dosing Seachem Stability to add the good bacteria to
the tank and have a bottle of Seachem Prime incase I need to take care
of any ammonia spike.

Originally, I planned on using an air stone to break up the surface
tension and add oxygen to the water.  With the 37-gallon tank though, I
didnâ€™t think this would be enough.  Therefore, I ordered a cheaper power
head that I will point to the surface.  If needed, I will run the air
stone as well.

That is pretty much all there is for the QT setup.  I will get some PVC
elbows to put in the tank for places for the fish to hide.  As I have a
wrasse, I also ordered a rectangle Pyrex bowl and some sand so he has a
place to bury himself.  Wrasses are usually harder to QT as they donâ€™t
handle the copper as well, but the Timor wrasse seems to be pretty easy
to quarantine based on what Iâ€™ve found online.

Everything I ordered should be here by Tuesday.  Iâ€™ll keep setting up
the system as things are delivered.  Once the Copper Power comes, Iâ€™ll
dose the QT and get it up to 1.0 PPM.  At that point I can start
breaking down my DT and moving all the fish.  It is important to ensure
there is no cross contamination of copper back to the DT as even small
amounts can kill the invertebrates and coral.

Once the last fish is removed from the DT, I will be increasing the
temperature to 80.6F.  A new study was recently released showing that at
80.6F, the fallow period to ensure all parasites are dead in the tank
and their cycle is broken, can be reduced to six weeks.  This will be
around the time the QT is finished.

The final step will be the Black Molly test.  Fresh water Black Mollies
can be converted to saltwater fish.  As saltwater fish, they have zero
immunity to any saltwater parasite.  You put 2-3 in the DT and in the
QT.  If they develop any spots at all, which are easy to see as the fish
is all black, you know you still have an issue.  If, after two weeks,
everyone is happy and healthy, then you are ready to slowly start moving
the fish back to the DT.  You donâ€™t want to add too many too fast as you
can mess with the DT bio load.  The Black Mollies will then either be
kept in the DT or I can convert them back to fresh water and get credit
at the LFS.

I know itâ€™s a long post today, but that is the plan.  Hopefully I donâ€™t
run into too many hiccups during the process.  Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll learn a lot
as I go through it and I will be quarantining all additional fish we may
buy before putting them in the display tank.  There is no way I want to
go through all of this again in the future!

Happy Reefing

P.S. â€“ I originally set up the QT in the family room on a bookshelf the
kids store their toys in.  We thought it would be pretty stable and able
to handle the weight.  Once the water was added, I noticed the bookshelf
was wobbly.  And, that is where the kids play rough, running and jumping
around.  I just had flashing of it falling on one of them.  So, I
removed all the water and moved the tank into the office on my TV stand.
Its much sturdier in here and out of the way where the kids can get hurt
ðŸ˜Š  But yeah, I basically had to set it up twice lolâ€¦
