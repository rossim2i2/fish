# New Aquascape (and Aptasia)

I’ve been reading forums and watching videos on reefing and one common
theme kept coming up. While beginner corals are great, they grow like
weeds and a year in you wish you never got them.

Due to this, I decided to move a smaller piece of rock to an island in
the sand bed by itself and move the GSP there.

Well... that turned into moving almost all the rock work around. I think
I would like some additional live rock to build the right side higher.
At first I didn’t like the way it looked but it seems to be growing on
me. And getting to the back of the tank to clean the sand bed is going
to be a lot easier.

Once the water cleared up a little more, I found what every refer
eventually finds but hopes not too... aptasia.

I haven’t seen it anywhere else in the tank so I removed the entire rock
and I’m letting it dry out so I can use it as dry rock in a future
project. I’m also going to pick up a peppermint shrimp in case there is
more that needs to be rooted out.
