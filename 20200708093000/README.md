# Green Star Polyps Eaten

Yesterday I noticed a patch of my GSPs were gone.  I was hoping
something aggravated them and they would come back, but looking at them
closer, it was clear they were eaten.  The only thing I can think of is
that the Emerald Crab got to them, but they are supposed to be reef
safe.

I posted some pictures and asked for feedback on Reef2Reef and while
most people at fist said they never had an issue the Emerald Crabs and
GSP, others eventually posted that they did have issues and some even
had video evidence!

I set up my camera in the hopes of getting the culprit in the act, but
the kids bumped into it and knocked it out of frame.  And of course more
was eaten while my camera pointed to the ceiling.

I was hoping to get proof of the culprit this morning, but its been
completely mowed down now.  The good news is that they grow very quickly
and it seems they can regenerate and come back in a fairly short amount
of time.  The bad news is that I have no choice but to try to catch and
remove the crab even though I don't have the proof it was him.  I have
24" reef safe tweezers coming this week and it should make plucking him
out easier.
