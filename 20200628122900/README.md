# Fish Today

Getting ready to head to the LFS and get the water tested. If levels
look good we should be coming home with a couple of clownfish!

Salinity 1.025
Water Temp 78.8

*UPDATE*
Got back home a little while ago. Ammonia and Nitrate levels were good
so we brought home three clownfish and a few coral frags. We can’t
really go crazy with coral until the lighting is upgraded and the tank
is mature. But we can start putting some hardier corals that don’t need
the intense lighting.

I will get better pictures of the coral after they fully open. Maybe for
tomorrow’s post. I’m also going to confirm what they are on a reef forum

Once the algae starts forming I’ll add the cleanup crew. In three weeks
we will get the water tested again and, if everything still looks good,
add more fish and coral!
