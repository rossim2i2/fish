# My Saltwater Aquarium(s)

I converted my blog, which was hosted by WordPress, to this `zet` repo.
My hosting renewal was due and I did not want to pay for the service
another year.

Now that I have this repo set up, I may start making more regular
updates and may even create a static website to replace the
rossiaquariums.com WordPress site.
