# Looking Good

Lights are on a timer and its nice to actually see the tank for a
change.  Fish seem to be happy and were fed a little yesterday.  Even
after the move, they had no problem gobbling down the food!  We are
going to switch their food daily between the pellet like food and frozen
mysis shrimp.

As for remembering the types of corals, I wasn't too far off.  What I
thought was a leather is actually a Colt Coral.  All corals opened up
fully yesterday and look great today.  Unless anything else happens
worth documenting, I will just be looking for algae accumulation so I
know when to put a clean up crew of snails, crabs and shrimp into the
tank.

Kids love it.
